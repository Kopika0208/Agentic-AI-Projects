## How It Works

1. Three AI "tools" generate email variants for a given product.
2. The Manager Agent tries each tool at least once, judges their outputs, and selects the best email.
3. A Subject Line Agent creates a compelling subject.
4. An HTML Formatter Agent styles the email body.
5. The final email is sent via SMTP or SendGrid.
